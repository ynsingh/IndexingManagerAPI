I have created an Indexing Manager API for a peer to peer network (Brihaspati 4). It will perform tasks of adding,deleting,updating and searching an Index entry. It will also run a maintenance thread to purge an entry depending on its timer type and time defined by user. I have used BouncyCastle provider for Cryptographic functions. This API will check periodically with Routing Manager API that for which all indexes I am root node or not. For this purpose a maintenance thread will run every 30 minutes. According to response those indexes for whom I am not root will be moved to Purge Table. Purge table will have timer of 90 minutes. If they are accessed within 90 minutes they will be transferred back to table of their layer ID.
