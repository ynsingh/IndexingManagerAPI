I have created an Indexing Manager API module for a peer to peer network(Brihaspati 4). It will perform tasks of adding,deleting,updating and searching an Index entry. It will also run a maintenance thread to purge an entry depending on its timer type and time defined by user. I have used BouncyCastle provider for Cryptographic functions. This API will check periodically with Routing Manager API that for which all indexes I am root node or not. For this purpose a maintenance thread will run every 30 minutes. According to response those indexes for whom I am not root will be moved to Purge Table whose layer Id I have kept as 100. Purge table will have timer of 90 minutes.
